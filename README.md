## How are graceful degredation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation is the strategy of retaining basic functionality even in the case where some parts may fial such as network issues. Service workers allow us as users to be able to still use the webapp by caching data. In the case of a network failing, the user would be still be able to access the content as far bak as was saved in the cache. These two iedas work together to maintain performance and reliability in multiple facets.
